            <h1>About Rainydays</h1>
            <p>Rainydays started with two girls from Norway who loved to explore the outdoors - by hiking the high mountains during the summer, skiing in the winter, camping by the coast - pushing the comfort zone.</p>
            <p>They would usually travel around to see as much as possible during their periods off from school and work, and soon realized they were in need of clothing that would fit to more than one type of weather and season of the year. I addition, it couldn’t be so expensive that they wouldn’t be able to afford traveling and exploring. Rainydays was born.</p>
            <p>Today we sell our jackets all over the world, and have a small office and an outlet located in Oslo, Norway.
